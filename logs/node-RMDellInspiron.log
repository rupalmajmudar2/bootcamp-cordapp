[WARN ] 2019-01-30T10:23:24,384Z [rpc-client-reaper-0] internal.RPCClientProxyHandler.onRemoval - A hot observable returned from an RPC was never subscribed to. This wastes server-side resources because it was queueing observations for retrieval. It is being closed now, but please adjust your code to call .notUsed() on the observable to close it explicitly. (Java users: subscribe to it then unsubscribe). This warning will appear less frequently in future versions of the platform and you can ignore it if you want to. {}
